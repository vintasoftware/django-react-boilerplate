# Django React Boilerplate

## About
A [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) project boilerplate/template with lots of state of the art libraries and tools like:
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), for building interactive UIs
- [django-js-reverse](https://github.com/ierror/django-js-reverse), for generating URLs on JS
- [Bootstrap 4](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/), for responsive styling
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), for bundling static assets
- [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/), for background worker tasks
- [WhiteNoise](http://whitenoise.evans.io/en/stable/) with [brotlipy](https://github.com/python-hyper/brotlipy), for efficient static files serving
- [prospector](https://prospector.landscape.io/en/master/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with [pre-commit](http://pre-commit.com/) for automated quality assurance (does not replace proper testing!)

For continuous integration, a [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) configuration `.circleci/config.yml` is included.

Also, includes a Heroku `app.json` and a working Django `production.py` settings, enabling easy deployments with ['Deploy to Heroku' button](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-button). Those Heroku plugins are included in `app.json`:
- PostgreSQL, for DB
- Redis, for Celery
- Sendgrid, for e-mail sending
- Papertrail, for logs and platform errors alerts (must set them manually)

This is a good starting point for modern Python/JavaScript web projects.

## Project bootstrap [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/vintasoftware/django-react-boilerplate.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/vintasoftware/django-react-boilerplate) [![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/vintasoftware/django-react-boilerplate.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)
- [ ] Install Django with `pip install django`, to have the `django-admin` command available.
- [ ] Open the command line and go to the directory you want to start your project in.
- [ ] Start your project using:
```
django-admin startproject theprojectname --extension py,yml,json --name Procfile,README.md,.env.example --template=https://github.com/vintasoftware/django-react-boilerplate/archive/boilerplate-release.zip
```
- [ ] Above: don't forget the `--extension` and `--name` params! (also don't forget to change `theprojectname` to your project's name).
- [ ] Navigate to the project's directory through your command line.
- [ ] Install pipenv if not installed yet: `pip install pipenv` (maybe you'll have to run this command as an OS superuser).
- [ ] Make sure you have Python 3.7 installed.
- [ ] `pipenv install --dev`
- [ ] Activate the newly created virtualenv with `pipenv shell`
- [ ] Change the first line of README to the name of the project.
- [ ] Add an email address to the `ADMINS` settings variable in `{{project_name}}/{{project_name}}/settings/base.py`
- [ ] Change the `SERVER_EMAIL` to the email address used to send e-mails in `{{project_name}}/{{project_name}}/settings/production.py`
- [ ] Rename the folder `circleci` to `.circleci` with the command `mv circleci .circleci`

After completing ALL of the above, remove this `Project bootstrap` section from the project README. Then follow `Running` below.

## Running
### Setup
- Inside the `backend` folder, do the following:
- Create a copy of ``{{project_name}}/settings/local.py.example``:  
  `cp {{project_name}}/settings/local.py.example {{project_name}}/settings/local.py` (remembering you should replace `{{project_name}}` with your project's name!).
- Create a copy of ``.env.example``:  
  `cp .env.example .env`
- Create the migrations for `users` app (do this, then remove this line from the README):  
  `python manage.py makemigrations`
- Run the migrations:  
  `python manage.py migrate`

### Tools
- Setup [editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/), [prospector](https://prospector.landscape.io/en/master/) and [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) in the text editor you will use to develop.

### Running the project
- Open a command line window and go to the project's directory.
- `pipenv install --dev`
- `npm install`
- `npm run start`
- Open another command line window and go to the `backend` directory.
- `pipenv shell`
- `python manage.py runserver`

#### Celery
- Open a command line window and go to the project's directory
- `pipenv shell`
- `python manage.py celery`

### Testing
`make test`

Will run django tests using `--keepdb` and `--parallel`. You may pass a path to the desired test module in the make command. E.g.:

`make test someapp.tests.test_views`

### Adding new pypi libs
Just run `pipenv install LIB_NAME_ON_PYPI` and then `pipenv lock` to lock the version in Pipfile.lock file

## Deployment 
### Setup
This project comes with a `app.json` file for heroku, that can be used to create an app on heroku from a GitHub repository.

After setting up the project, you can init a repository and push it on GitHub. If your repository is public, you can use the following button:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy) 

If you are in a private repository, access the following link replacing `$YOUR_REPOSITORY_LINK$` with your repository link.

- `https://heroku.com/deploy?template=$YOUR_REPOSITORY_LINK$`

Remember to fill the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` with the URL of your app, the default on heroku is `appname.herokuapp.com`. Replace `appname` with your heroku app name.

### Sentry

[Sentry](https://sentry.io) is already set up on the project. For production, add `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable on Heroku, with your Sentry DSN as the value.

You can test your Sentry configuration by deploying the boilerplate with the sample page and clicking on the corresponding button.

### Sentry source maps for JS files

The `bin/post_compile` script has a step to push Javascript source maps to Sentry, however some environment variables need to be set on Heroku.

You need to enable Heroku dyno metadata on your Heroku App. Use the following command on Heroku CLI:

- `heroku labs:enable runtime-dyno-metadata -a <app name>`

The environment variables that need to be set are:

- `SENTRY_ORG` - Name of the Sentry Organization that owns your Sentry Project.
- `SENTRY_PROJECT_NAME` - Name of the Sentry Project.
- `SENTRY_API_KEY` - Sentry API key that needs to be generated on Sentry. [You can find or create authentication tokens within Sentry](https://sentry.io/api/).

After enabling dyno metadata and setting the environment variables, your next Heroku Deploys will create a release on Sentry where the release name is the commit SHA, and it will push the source maps to it.

## Linting
- Manually with `prospector` and `npm run lint` on project root.
- During development with an editor compatible with prospector and ESLint.

## Pre-commit hooks
- Run `pre-commit install` to enable the hook into your git repo. The hook will run automatically for each commit.
- Run `git commit -m "Your message" -n` to skip the hook if you need.

## Commercial Support
This project, as other Vinta open-source projects, is used in products of Vinta clients. We are always looking for exciting work, so if you need any commercial support, feel free to get in touch: contact@vinta.com.br
